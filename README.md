# Squirrels Gone Nuts - Master's Capstone Project

## Objective

Build a fast-paced, 2D, multiplayer, arena shooter. This project aims to develop a multiplayer videogame that produces a competitive
and fast-paced environment for players.

## Background

Multiplayer videogames are in high demand with network programmers being the backbone of
those games. The goal of this project is to develop my network programming skills and improve
my game design and development skills overall.

## Current Project

The current project focuses on developing a fast-paced shooter with a unique movement
system.

The project will be a 2D side-view platform shooter. Players will operate in two different
modes: combat mode and parkour mode. The combat mode will have limited movement but
allow the player to shoot weapons and use combat-specific abilities. The parkour mode will
allow the player to move at a higher speed with the cost of not being able to use their weapon.

The movement system is what sets this game apart from others. There will be a strong
emphasis on utilizing verticality when maneuvering around the map. With this, the player will
be able to climb on any surface in the game like they are on the ground. This will increase the
skill ceiling in the game that competitive players enjoy. The goal is to create a simple movement
system that allows for creativity. The combination of these two things will create a low barrier
to entry but high player retention as players can increase their skills with time.

In shooter games, the time to kill, map design, and movement system dictate the pace of the
game. As the goal is to make a fast-paced environment, the game will implement a medium-high time to
kill, an open map design, and a fast movement system.

To start, the game will implement a casual matchmaking system, and as a stretch goal, a ranked
matchmaking system. The casual matchmaking system will randomly place players in lobbies
with a few filters such as player’s region and game mode selection. The ranked matchmaking
system will be like the casual system except it will pit players of similar skill rating against each
other instead of at random.

Another stretch goal would be implementing a profile system to keep track of players’ stats, in-game friends, and skill rating.

## Challenges

The following are some of the challenges in this project:

- Creating a movement and combat system that enhances the player experience with a
low barrier to entry and a high skill ceiling.
- Creating quality character animations for a dynamic environment.
- Designing unique maps with good flow and pacing.
- Player synchronization and other multiplayer issues that arise with network
programming.
- Designing a matchmaking system that creates a fair and fun player environment.

## Project Schedule

The following schedule is proposed by the student. The project development will be broken
down into four phases. The first phase will consist of building the core gameplay mechanics
such as movement, combat, and player animations. The second phase will consist of
multiplayer aspects such as client to server synchronization and matchmaking. The third phase
will contain all aspects of polishing the game such as refined sound and music design, menu
design, map design, etc. The fourth phase will consist of real-time testing and fixes and the
project report. Design diagrams will be created as and when the phases are being developed.

Development on the project will begin in Summer 2022 and the estimated completion date will be in Sprint 2024.

## Resources

The student will use his personal computer and free to use development tools to complete the
project. The tools include:
- Unity3D – Game engine
- Aseprite – Sprite editor
- Visual Studio Code – Text editor
- Git/GitHub – Version control
- Notion - Project management
